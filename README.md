# Patch Jumper

![Game Preview](preview.png)

You are a stressed-out engineer. Run through a field of bugs, collect fixes, avoid conflicts, donâ€™t lose your HEAD, and push the build before the deadline.

This game was made in Godot, thrown together in 30 minutes on a Saturday â€” right after a teammate lost their HEAD (literally) in a bad merge and got really upset.

P.S. Any resemblance to real CAD tools or other products is purely in your imagination.

P.S. P.S. Everything here is piled together in the messiest way possible â€” please donâ€™t do this in real projects! ðŸ˜…

All the CAD tools Iâ€™ve ever made live on in my heart.
